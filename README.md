## plcnext
A node package for use with PLCnext Technologyâ„¢ controllers from Phoenix Contact.

## Code Example

```JavaScript
var plcnext = require("plcnext");

// Create program templates.
var nodeTemplateArray = plcnext.getPrograms("/opt/plcnext/projects/PCWE/Plc/Meta/PCWE.meta.config");

// Create the set of program instances.
var nodeProgramArray = plcnext.getProgramInstances("/opt/plcnext/projects/PCWE/Plc/Plm/PCWE.acf.config", "/opt/plcnext/projects/PCWE/Plc/Esm/PCWE.esm.config");

// Create connections between programs.
var linkDataArray = plcnext.getConnections("/opt/plcnext/projects/PCWE/Plc/Gds/PCWE.gds.config");

// Write program connections back to the PLC.
plcnext.setConnections(linkDataArray, "/opt/plcnext/projects/PCWE/Plc/Gds/PCWE.gds.config")
  
```

## Motivation

This package includes functions for reading and writing information from PLCnext configuration files.  
These functions can be used to build node applications that run directly on the PLCnext platform.

## Installation

npm install plcnext

## API Reference

The schema definition for objects returned by functions are documented separately.

**getGlobalObjects ()**

**getIoModules (ticFileName)**  
Returns an array of IO modules configured in the TIC file.

**getProjects ()**  
Returns an array containing the names of all projects stored on the PLC.

**getPrograms (metaConfigFilename)**  
Returns an array of library/component/program definitions contained in the metadata configuration file.

**getProgramInstances (acfConfigFilename, esmConfigFilename)**  
Returns an array of component/program instances contained in the ACF and ESM configuration files.

**getConnections (gdsFileName)**  
Returns an array of connections contained in the GDS configuration file.
Connections may be between ports on program instances, I/O modules or global objects.

**setConnections (linkData, gdsFileName)**  
Writes the connections defined in linkData to the GDS configuration file.
